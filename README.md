## Evaluating the performance of past climate model projections

These notebooks, scripts, and data correspond to the analysis in Hausfather, Drake, Abbott, and Schmidt (2019), Evaluating the performance of past climate model projections, *Geophysical Research Letters*, https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL085378.

The `environment.yml` file contains the python dependencies necessary to run the data processing notebooks. Figures 1, 2, S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5 were produced offline using the plotting software *STATA* based on the raw data in `data/raw` and the interim data files in `data/processed`, which are produced by the notebook `notebooks/Obs forcing analysis.ipynb` from the data files in `data/raw`. Figures 3 and S6 were produced using the python notebooks `notebooks/plot_temperature_forcing_spaghetti.ipynb` and `notebooks/plot_temperature_forcing_FAR_spaghetti.ipynb` based on the data in `data/processed/`.
